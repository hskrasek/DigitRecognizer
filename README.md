# DigitRecognizer

While in college we had a class called Software Engineering II. The goal of the class was to teach various methods and tools of software engineering and system analysis. Previously in Software Engineering I we did this as a team, this time around it focused more on individual projects.

I took on the [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) project from Kaggle, and set off to develop a Python application to recognize handwritten digits with machine learning techniques.
